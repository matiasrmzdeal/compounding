            <h2>Matias Ramirez de Alva</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Matias Ramirez de Alva, I am a senior at the University of Texas, working towards a Bachelors of Science in Economics, with an Applied Statistical Modeling Certificate.</p>
            <p>Born in Mexico City, I spent most of my education in the United States, graduating from St. Thomas High School in Houston, Texas. My diverse background provides me with a cultural understanding of and fluency in both Spanish and English. I am extremely driven and eager to learn, values that I believe are reflected in my academic and extra-curricular achievements. </p>
            <p>I am particularly interested in computer science, and passionate about using powerful programming languages such as Python and R to interpret data, create models, and make useful predictions. UT has provided me with several classes that have deepened my understanding of these topics, both economic statistics and programming classes, and I have been able to apply what I have learned in projects that extend beyond the classroom. </p>
            <p>This past year I have been working at PROXDIS Inc., an incredible startup in the medical device field. In my role as an intern, I wore many hats, contributing to everything from market and competitor research, preparing for raising funds, and marketing. Most of all, my experience has been one of learning from the incredible team, who gave me firsthand insights into the startup mindset, innovating at a fast pace, all while providing expertise from their decades of experience in the medical device industry, and prioritizing customer service. </p>
            <p>Im always eager to look for opportunities where I can further my learning and take part in meaningful work in my fields.</p>
